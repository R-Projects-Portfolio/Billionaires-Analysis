# Billionaires Analysis

In this project I analysed the top 20 Billionaires of year 1996, 2001, 2014 & 2022.

Data collected from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/forbes-worlds-billionaires-list-2022)

This is how our data looks after cleaning it in Excel.


![dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166159488-57e0f845-0a75-4a97-9af0-696e79f2d6ae.png)


First we see the year-wise change in the Net Worth of Top 20 people.


![Yearwise Change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166159537-aa28503c-7c8e-419c-9cfd-ace441b9629b.png)


So we can see that the increase in wealth has undergone a steep rise from 2014 to 2022.

Next let's see which industries are these people associated with.


![Industry-wise Distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166159694-77b36dbe-4307-4cf9-9355-65d2bc0ac568.png)


We can see that Consumer, Real Estate, Retail & Restaurant, Money-Management, Media & Computer-Technology make up almost 67% of all the industries. 

Let's see the Top 6 Industries.


![Top 6 Industries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166159821-9d27c298-e948-498d-91b4-e94e5fbed433.png)


Now we saw from the dataset that there are a total of 73 countries from which these Billionaires belong.
Having more number of Billionaire will definately affect the country as that implies more revenue & tax collection, job creation and manufacturing.

Let's see the top 20 countries which have the most Billionaires.


![Country wise Distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166159914-32977477-2305-4905-a6d9-f99c538e952f.png)



So we can see that United States of America has the most Billionaires, which is almost 6 times that of the next country and more than the sum of next 10 countries. 
That certainly explains why USA is considered a rich country.

Now let's see how the sum of Top 20 Billionaires has changed over the years. 
Our dataset has values for the Years 1996, 2001, 2014 & 2022.


![Total Worth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166160087-bc4c4676-f6d4-4de9-9966-2b7bb50f878e.png)

So we can see that the total of net-worths of top 20 Billionaires has increased more by the year.

We can also see the change in total net-worth of Billionaires by countries over the years.


![Country-Year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166160192-eb4eb166-1eda-48bf-994a-71458ad6af81.png)


We can see from the above graph that USA, India and France in that order are the biggest collaborators to this steep increase in growth over the years.

Let's see the percent change in each country's increase.


![Country](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166160298-c93e43da-87af-48cc-b4a3-b18aa1385a1f.png)


So we can see that USA saw a big increase from 1996 to 2001 and since then has not grown as much, whereas India which is not even in the top 10 till 2014 has suddenly become the 2nd biggest contributor in 2022, and France has had a steady growth since 1996 to 2014 but not much since then.


Now let's see the distribution of this wealth by Industry.


![Industry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166160490-987b7249-2345-42f0-82e1-d05e2e780920.png)


We can see from the above charts that Real Estate which was the top contributor of wealth in 1996 has gradually decreased since then and has totally dropped out of the top 20 people's wealth by 2022, whereas as Consumer, Retail and Computer Technology are slowly becoming the top contributors to Billionaires wealth.


Now let's see what is the male-female ratio of Top 20 Billionaires over the years.


![Male-Female](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166160631-d9a8684b-7613-4338-acc1-f52b44872b92.png)


We can see that the percentage has increased drastically from 1996 to 2001 but has dropped since then.
One reason a lot of women are dropping out of work force in a lot of countries is that as wealth of the family increases, women choose to or are made to stay at home instead of going to work. This has also declined the percentage of women in workforce world-wide by a significant amount.

Now, let's see how many of these Billionaires have inherited their wealth and how many are self made.


![Inherited](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166160768-3de4c29f-fed8-4628-846a-c0afc4b04e93.png)


We can see from the charts that the percentage of people who Inherited their Billions increased from 1996 to 2001, but is decreasing gradually since, and a rise in the percentage of Self Made Billionaires is visible.

Finally, let's see how many people have been in the Top 20 list and how consistent they are.
So from the data we know that there are a total of 51 people in the list of Top 20 during the specified years.

![Person Frequency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97380339/166160897-22719ee6-9c96-4fad-92e9-fe7c2cc879d7.png)

We can see that more than 25% of these people have been in the Top 20 Billionaires List for more than 10 years.
